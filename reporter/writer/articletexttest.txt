States can legalize MDMA for pharmaceutical use even if the federal government does not

The emerging psychedelic pharmaceutical industry was dealt a shock on June 4 after a U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel recommended the rejection of Lykos Therapeutics’ application to have MDMA (methylenedioxymethamphetamine) approved as a prescription medicine to treat post-traumatic stress disorder.

As the first psychedelic medicine to receive the FDA’s “breakthrough status” designation, a designation that may accelerate the adoption of promising treatments, MDMA has the potential to pave the way for a new and powerful niche in mental health pharmaceuticals.

While the federal government might have hit a roadblock in legalizing MDMA for pharmaceutical use, state governments can still move forward in legalizing access to the psychedelic.

Politically, it has been easier for state lawmakers to defer to the FDA to approve new medications. However, it is unclear whether any psychedelic pharmaceutical company can overcome the research methods standards at the FDA and successfully introduce a new drug.

In the case of MDMA, the FDA recognized its unique potential by granting the substance a “breakthrough therapy” designation, and clinical trials generally confirmed the safety and effectiveness of the drug in treating post-traumatic stress disorder. However, progress has been halted by the FDA advisory panel’s reluctance to recommend approval of a psychedelic medicine.

One reason why FDA advisors might be reluctant to move forward on MDMA is due to concerns about the techniques used in the clinical trials. One concern is that a high number of participants can identify when they are in the placebo group, defeating the long-held gold standard of a control group that is “blind” to whether they received the drug. Researchers have attempted different mathematical techniques and survey questions to address issues around blinding and other concerns. When these approaches are applied to clinical trial data, the statistical differences between the placebo and treatment groups become harder to distinguish.

But, even with advancements in research techniques, it might take some time for FDA regulators to fully come around to the idea of MDMA for pharmaceutical use, which makes the federal drug approval pathway difficult and uncertain. However, just as with legalizing cannabis, states can create pathways of their own to enable access to pharmaceutical MDMA.

Oregon and Colorado have already legalized the use of another promising psychedelic, psilocybin, in professional treatments. As the active ingredient in “magic mushrooms,” psilocybin is still federally illegal, and there are ongoing clinical trials of synthetic versions. While legalizing plants, such as cannabis and psychedelic mushrooms, is easier for states because consumers can grow them, it is also possible to legalize the manufacturing of synthetic chemicals, such as MDMA.

For instance, California State Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco) had originally proposed legalizing MDMA in Senate Bill 1012. The MDMA inclusion was later stripped out of the bill, which ultimately failed to pass. Had it passed with the MDMA component, the bill would have required a state agency to disseminate specific manufacturing practices.

While these are a few examples, states have many options when considering the legalization or decriminalization of psychedelic medicines within their borders. They could choose to allow a company with basic safety and efficacy evidence, such as Lykos’s MDMA compound, exclusive rights to manufacture in the state. Legislators could propose pilot programs similar to those in Japan, where consumers may purchase access to participate in early drug trials that have already passed basic safety standards. Or, states may allow direct sales from multiple manufacturers, as many now do with cannabis products.

To be sure, this is new territory. States have not had to develop comprehensive protocols for therapy paired with synthetic pharmaceuticals. However, Oregon has established a clinical protocol for psilocybin-assisted therapy using products manufactured under exacting state standards. The main difference between this approach and a synthetic medicine like MDMA is that the active compound is derived through a chemical reaction rather than a plant extract.

Regardless, in the wake of the FDA advisory panel’s reaction to MDMA, it now seems clear that the locus of action for psychedelic therapies will be at the state level, just as it has been for medical marijuana.

State psychedelics legalization and policy roundup — May 2024
Legislative progress slows, a Massachusetts ballot initiative moves forward, and Colorado rejects censorship.

This post is part of an ongoing series summarizing state-based psychedelic reforms intended for policy professional professionals. 

There was a normal winnowing of many exciting legislative proposals in the first quarter of 2024 as momentum flattened and the restrictive status quo won the day. Psychedelic activists, however, continue to make progress throughout the country, despite pushback.

In California, state Sen. Scott Weiner’s (D-San Francisco) Senate Bill 1012 has failed to secure support from the Senate Finance Committee. The bill would have created a market of regulated, in-person psychedelic therapy with state-certified professionals, similar to what is already implemented in Oregon. His proposal was introduced as a response to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s previous veto of a bill last year to decriminalize some botanical psychedelics.

Weiner’s fellow legislators had reportedly demanded more restrictions to limit access to in-person, professionally guided experiences to require providers of psychedelic-assisted therapy to hold a valid California medical or therapy license.

We argue in an op-ed that these restrictions would substantially increase costs and compromise public safety by driving consumer demand into the illicit market.

In Maryland, state Sen. Brian Feldman’s (D-District 15) Senate Bill 1009 to create a working group to study psychedelic therapy progressed quickly through both legislative chambers. It was signed into law on May 16.

In Wisconsin, lawmakers introduced House Bill 753 to create a pilot program for medicinal psilocybin. In April, it failed.

In Illinois, state Sen. Rachel Ventura (D-District 43) introduced Senate Bill 3695 in February to establish a regulated botanical psychedelics market by 2027. It is similar to Oregon’s model of professionally facilitated psilocybin-assisted therapy. Notably, this bill includes ibogaine, a promising but controversial drug addiction treatment. It is currently working its way through the state Senate.

In Vermont, state Sen. Martine Gulick’s (D-Chittenden Central District) bill, Senate 114, to create an advisory group on psilocybin decriminalization, was sent to the governor’s desk on May 10.

In Alaska, state Rep. Jennie Armstrong’s (D-District 16) House Bill 228 was approved by the legislature and is awaiting the governor’s signature. If ratified, the legislature would create a task force to recommend regulatory changes should the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approve a psychedelic medicine.

In Maine, state Sen. Donna Bailey (D-District 14) introduced Senate Bill 1914 to create a regulated market. However, the bill was watered down through amendments to create a commission charged with studying and making recommendations about structuring a regulated market.

In Rhode Island, state Rep. Brandon Potter’s (D-District 16) bill, House Bill 7047, which would have temporarily removed penalties for possessing psilocybin until mid-2026, was given an unfavorable ruling by the House’s Judiciary Committee in February and is unlikely to pass this year.

In New York, Assemblywoman Amy Paulin (D-District 88) introduced AB 10375 to allow adult cultivation and sharing of psilocybin once a consumer obtains a permit. A permit requires a health screening and educational courses.

Massachusetts gears up for ballot initiative qualification
A Massachusetts ballot initiative to legalize the non-commercial sharing of botanical psychedelics and create a regulated framework similar to Colorado’s proposition 122 is making steady progress towards qualifying for this November’s ballot. And, just like in Colorado, many political and public health institutions are lining up to oppose it.

One group, reportedly associated with Massachusetts General Hospital, has filed paperwork to oppose the measure because of a provision that allows homegrown psilocybin. Additionally, a joint committee from the legislature has released a report arguing that personal possession would undermine a state-regulated therapy program.

Reason Foundation has responded with a commentary arguing that the ballot initiative would not be a threat to public health and would provide access to potentially life-changing psychedelics.

Colorado considers restrictions on drug-related speech
In Colorado, Senate Bill 158 stalled in the House’s Committee on Education in May. The bill was ostensibly designed to protect minors on social media platforms. Social media companies would have to collect sensitive information to verify a minor’s age and retain this information so that their security processes could be audited. It also would have imposed new requirements on social media companies to ban any user accounts that advertised illicit activities, such as drug use and unlawful firearm sales.

Reason Foundation published an opinion piece detailing how the bill, among other issues, would restrict personal and corporate speech related to products that are fully legal under state law, including psychedelics.

Sponsors appear poised for a renewed push in the next session.
